# Programming (Visual Studio)
Occasionally, issues will arise with your Loco.fy exports and you may be required to modify code or re-write original TypeScript using the React API. This document will contain some basic information about quick-tip troubleshooting and coding, while more detailed instructions can be found in the [NodeJS Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/debugging).

Otherwise, for most programming, I recommend using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code (as outlined in the Prequisites README). You can find more information on both [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html), the language that we program in, on their respective websites. But, both should be relatively compatible with each other upon install; if there are any issues, Visual Studio should prompt you in the right corner of the screen with plugins and tips that can help quickly resolve them.

With that said, you likely won't need to do anything in Visual Studio outside of programming simple changes; you can use CTRL+S to save the file as is if you simply open the GitHub repository in VSCode. This can either be done by right clicking on a file and tapping "Open with Visual Studio Code", setting Visual Studio to open .tsx files by default, and/or opening Visual Studio and then simply dragging in the repository folder from your Desktop. 

> NOTE: If you've never used a programming IDE before, you may want to check out some resources that demonstrate how programming in VSCode works (like the ones linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqCgcpAypFQ)). Otherwise, if you've used something like IntelliJ or Eclipse, it should seem relatively familiar in its layout and functionality -- Google has an abundance of resources available to answer any of your questions!
