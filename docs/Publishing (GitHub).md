# Publishing (GitHub)
When you've made changes that you'd like to publish, you should be able to publish the new version of the app on your fork of this GitHub repository! If you have not yet created a fork of the repo, please check out the Prequisites README file for a brief tutorial!

## Branches
Before making a change to the main branch of the repository, it's best to publish your change in a secondary branch so that it can later be reverted if it ends up destroying your program. For this repository, that branch is typically the /beta/, though you're always welcome to [create another one](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) if you need additional back-ups.
