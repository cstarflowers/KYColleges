# KYColleges Docs
Hello! If you're reading this, you're likely looking for documentation on how to manage the KYColleges prototype(s); I'm happy to say that you've come to the right place! In this subfolder, you should find information about how to use major pieces of software (including XD, Expo, and NPM), as well as tips/tricks for how we used tools like TypeScript and CSS to develop our application. 

Thus, before you actually begin your development process, I encourage you to read up on some of the tools that you may be unfamiliar with, as well as plan out a potential path with Luke and Taylor for how you'd like to implement your suggested changes rather than simply committing them to this GitHub page (a trap I've unfortunately fallen into far too many times...)! Likewise, also please consider reviewing our cards in [RiseUp's Azure](https://dev.azure.com/RiseUpAcademicsKY/Rise%20Up%20Academics%20Ignite/_backlogs/backlog/Rise%20Up%20Academics%20Ignite%20Team/Epics) to ensure that you don't run into any of the same issues we did throughout the app development process.

As always, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to Carson via email at starofluca@gmail.com (or @cstarflowers)! Happy developing!
