# Building (Expo)
Expo is one of the most important applications we used to develop the original KYColleges app, but likely not one that you'll have to interact with much as you continue to deploy updates. They have their own documentation available [here](https://docs.expo.dev/), but the following will provide some quick tips and important info for getting started as well:

## Repository Access
The repository is currently located at [riseup-academics/projects](https://expo.dev/accounts/riseup-academics/projects/kycolleges), but was also formerly located [here](https://expo.dev/accounts/carsonstary/projects/kycolleges) if you notice any link has failed to redirect. To access this repository, you will need to be invited to the RiseUp-Academics organization on Expo, which can only be done through a private email. 

If you have access already and need to invite someone else to view the repository, navigate to the ["Members" tab](https://expo.dev/accounts/riseup-academics/settings/members) of your homepage, then click "Invite" and type in the top right corner and type in the invitee's email. For the permissions checkbox, I would recommend granting any developer "Admin", but "Developer" will also likely suffice if they need to make changes; this level can be changed at any point later down the line.

## Builds
It's more likely than not you won't end up using Expo during the development process apart from the API contained in your NodeJS installation (see Prerequisites README). However, builds are also a pretty useful feature that can help you determine whether or not your code is functioning correctly! To do so, you'll more than likely want to type `eas build --platform android`, but you're free to change these build settings depending on what you're testing. After that, you can watch to see the build progress through the [online portal](https://expo.dev/accounts/riseup-academics/projects/kycolleges/builds), which should tell you if there are any major compiler errors/if the app can be effectively condensed down to what we'd list on something like the Apple or Google Play Store. Though, if you intend to use builds for more than simply checking for functionality problems before listing, it may be a wise idea to consult the [EAS Build Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) instead.
